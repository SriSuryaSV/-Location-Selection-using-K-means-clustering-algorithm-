## Location Analysis using K-Means Clustering

An analysis using geospatial data and advanced machine learning techniques has been conducted to identify the optimal location for a new Indian restaurant in New York City. By collecting and utilizing data from various sources on existing Indian restaurants in the area, a robust K-Means Clustering model was developed and applied to identify clusters of similar cuisine. Through this process, a location was selected that not only possesses a high potential for success but also a unique culinary niche with minimal competition. This approach ensures that the new restaurant will stand out in a crowded market and have the best chance for success.
